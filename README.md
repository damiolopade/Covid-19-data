# Project Objective
The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19 which started in 2019 and its resulting condition, has caught much of the world off-guard. It is already clear that the crisis is thoroughly global in nature, recently the WHO requested that people should go back to using a nosemask, hence we want to analyse the global confirmed, death, recovery cases and the rate.
